bresenham.m convexHull.m fill\_boundary.m fill.m are MATLAB function files.

run\_tasks.m is MATLAB script that calls individual functions and performs the required tasks and plots figures etc.

I don't have an interface for reading plolygons from file. so pls simply change the parameter in run\_tasks.m for trying out different polygons/points/etc.
